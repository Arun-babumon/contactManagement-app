# contactManagement-app
Here i have created a login page for the authentication of  the existing user
by default i have created the  username and password as admin.
as we are trying to login the input from username and password is compared to our existing database 
if the username and password are matches with our login credentials on our database(username:admin,password:admin) 
then the user is  granted access to the application.
the interface is created using java.
